# Genetic Algorithm with Race Cars

## Overview

This project is a car simulation that utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve car behaviors over time. The simulation is built using the p5.js library and demonstrates the principles of genetic algorithms.

## Features

- **Simulation of Cars**: Cars navigate a track, learning over time to improve their performance.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Implements genetic principles like natural selection, crossover, and mutation.
- **Interactive Track**: Users can interact with the simulation, potentially altering the course or conditions.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Open the Project**
Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Prerequisites
This project requires no special installations if run in a web browser. It uses p5.js, which is included via CDN in the HTML file.

## Technologies Used
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used for the simulation logic.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
- `js/sketch.js`: Contains the main logic for the simulation.
- `css/style.css`: Contains styles for the application.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE` file for details.
